# svg-to-android-drawable-png
A simple shell script to convert a svg file to android drawable pngs with multiple dpi.

**Usage:**
- You need to have [svgexport](https://github.com/shakiba/svgexport) installed
- `sudo chmod +x conv_icon.sh` if you need
- `conv_icon.sh file1 file2 file3 ...` (without extensions)

**Example**
`convert_icon.sh ic_check_circle_white_48px ic_delete_white_48px`

This script is for my personal usage.
